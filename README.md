Universal Numerical Fingerprint


The Universal Numerical Fingerprint (UNF) is a cryptographic signature of the approximated semantic content of a digital object.
It is computed on the normalized (or canonicalized) forms of the data values, and is thus independent of the storage 
medium and format of the data. 

This Java UNF library is the reference implementation for UNF. Issues are tracked in the Dataverse issue tracker at https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues because Dataverse makes use of this library.
