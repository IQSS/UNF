Universal Numerical Fingerprint


The Universal Numerical Fingerprint (UNF) is a cryptographic signature of the approximated semantic content of a digital object.
It is computed on the normalized (or canonicalized) forms of the data values, and is thus independent of the storage 
medium and format of the data.
